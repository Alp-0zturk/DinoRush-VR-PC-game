<h2> DinoRush 3D VR-PC Game </h2>
<body>
  <h4> DinoRush game is a final project for my "Special Topics in Computer Engineering" class. </h4>
    <h4> Explanation: </h4>
      <p> * DinoRush is an 3D infinite platform game inspired by Google's 2D Dinosaur game. <br>
          * The objective is to travel the farthest distance while dodging the obstacles. <br>
          * The player always goes forward automatically and the game gets faster by time alive. <br>
      </p>		
      <h4> Controls: </h4>
	<p> for PC: <br>
      	  * A to move left, D to move to right. <br>
	  * Space to jump above fence obstacle. <br>
        </p>	
      	<p> for Oculus Quest VR: <br>
      	  * I have used XR Interaction Manager to implement the game to VR controller. <br>
        </p>
<br>
<p>	I have personalized the game by adding hit animation and sounds. <br>
	This game has keyboard support. You can play in PC if you can run .apk file in your computer.
	You can find the trailer for PC in the repository. <br>
</p>
