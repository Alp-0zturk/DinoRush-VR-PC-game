<body>
  <h4> DinoRush game is a final project for my "Special Topics in Computer Engineering" class. </h4>
    <h5> Explanation: </h5>
      <p> DinoRush is an infinite platform game inspired by Google's 2D Dinosaur game.
          The objective is to travel the farthest distance while dodging the obstacles.
          The player always goes forward automatically and the game gets faster by time alive.
