  <h4> DinoRush game is a final project for my "Special Topics in Computer Engineering" class. </h4>
    <h4> Explanation: </h4>
      <p> * DinoRush is an infinite platform game inspired by Google's 2D Dinosaur game. <br>
          * The objective is to travel the farthest distance while dodging the obstacles. <br>
          * The player always goes forward automatically and the game gets faster by time alive. <br>
